                <h1 class="text-h1-sobre">The history of the hamburger</h1>
                <p>Before becoming so popular in some countries like the United States, the hamburger was already consumed by ancient peoples in Western Asia.</p>
                <p>It was the Tartars, one of the main tribes of the Mongol people, in the 13th century, who are said to have originated the consumption of a type of minced meat shaped into a flattened ball, which was eaten within bread, making it a very practical food for the troops invading Europe at that time.</p>
                <p>German travelers during the 17th century brought the idea to butchers in the city of Hamburg, who developed techniques for grinding the meat. With this seasoned ground meat, they created steaks that, in addition to being tasty, had a low cost and quickly became popular throughout the city.</p>
                <p>The first immigrants from Germany arrived in the United States, bringing with them the famous minced meat steak recipe.</p>
                <p>The first Americans who consumed the hamburger were sailors, and they named it 'hamburg steak.' Gradually, the recipe gained popularity and came to be called by the name it is known by today: hamburger.</p>
                    <img class="text-img-right" src="img/white.png">
                <p>The great popularity of the hamburger occurred in the early 19th century due to its convenience. The industrial revolution was in full swing in the United States, and as a result, there was a need for food that could be prepared quickly and inexpensively to feed all the workers.</p>
                <p>During this time, ice cream carts and hot dogs were already in existence, ideas that had also come to the country through the Germans. In 1921, the first fast-food chain in the United States, White Castle, emerged, selling a cooked version of the hamburger seasoned with onions.</p>
                    <img class="text-img-left" src="img/Mc.jpg">
                <p>In the 20th century, many diners began selling the recipe. In the 1930s, drive-ins brought even more popularity to it. In 1937, brothers Maurice and Dick McDonald opened their first drive-in in California, initiating a major revolution in the world of fast food.</p>
                <p>From there, the recipe won over Americans and spread throughout the world. Over time, the recipes became more sophisticated, and various other versions of the dish emerged.</p>
